Another odd thing is median for being 2, further the average is 3.26. \nWhich means most of the TV shows have only up-to few seasons. I would guess not more than 5.\n\nSummary of date indicates the earliest TV show from 1990 and latest from 2018. So the year difference\nis 28 years, but there are only 1808 distinct values. Even though the data-set contains 2266 observations.\nSome TV shows might have to start on the same day, that is the only plausible conclusion.\n\n\"av_rating\" (I presume Audio/Video Rating) is in the scale from 1 to 10, where people had influence. \nThe least rating value is 2.7 and the most rating value is 9.68, but the median is 8.11. \nAlso the mean is 8.06. We can say most of these TV shows are excellent to watch. There is another\nnumeric variable called share and the value ranges from 0 to 55.65 where the average is 1.28.\n\n# Genre\n\nGenres in this data-set has close to 100 distinct factors. The category \"Crime,Drama,Mystery\"\nholds the highest percentage of 16.3, while second place is to \"Comedy,Drama\" with 7.7% and\nthird place is to \"Drama\" type with 7.4%. All the other types of genre is represented by less than 7%.\n\n## Genre and Season\n\nGenre and Season are two categorical variables which should be compared to find out if over time do\npeople like the same genre type. If we look at the bar plot it is clear \"Crime,Drama,Mystery\" type\nhas seasons from 1 to 20. Mostly in all genres there is clear sign of TV shows with seasons up-to\nthree or four. Some of them make it to season ten or eleven, for example genres like \"Drama\", \n\"Drama,Thriller\", \"Animation,Comedy,Drama\" and \"Adventure,Drama,Family\".\n\nOddly in \"Drama,Romance\" and \"Crime,Drama\" there are TV shows which has seasons above 35 but very few.\nIt becomes more weird where for the same genre types the seasons in-between 25 and 34 are missing.\nClearly in the legend also until season 20 there is continuity, but this does not carry on for higher\nseasons.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(Ratings,aes(x=fct_infreq(factor(genres)),fill=factor(seasonNumber)))+\n  geom_bar()+ coord_flip()+labs(fill=\"Season\")+\n  xlab(\"Genre\")+ylab(\"Frequency\")+\n  ggtitle(\"Genre and Seasons\")+\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,375,25),labels=seq(0,375,25))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/Genre vs Season-1.png){width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Genre and Year\n\nBar plot indicates that after 2014 around 90% of these genre type TV shows have been done. \nIn the top ten category according to the counts of TV shows clearly all of these genres have\nbeen active since 1990 to now. Some of them were started in mid 1990s which include the genre types\n\"Action,Crime,Drama\", \"Crime,Drama\" and \"Comedy,Crime,Drama\". \n\nTypes such as \"Drama,Romance,Sport\" and \"Adventure,Drama,Romance\" were in active in the mid 2000s but\nno longer. Genres such as \"Drama,History\", \"Drama,Horror,Thriller\" and \"Action,Drama\" are a few of them\nwhich were popular after 2012. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(Ratings,aes(x=fct_infreq(factor(genres)),fill=factor(year(date))))+\n  geom_bar()+ coord_flip()+labs(fill=\"Year\")+\n  xlab(\"Genre\")+ylab(\"Frequency\")+\n  ggtitle(\"Genre Over the Year\")+\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,375,25),labels=seq(0,375,25))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/Genre vs Year-1.png){width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Genre and Month\n\nMonth of airing might have an influence on the TV shows.

Some are limited seasons close to four or above,\nbut definitely less than 10. It is very rare to see TV shows going beyond the 15 seasons mark.\n\n## Season and Year\n\nClearly there is an increase in TV shows aired over the years. All time low occurs in 1992 but\nall time high occurs in 2017. From 1990 to 2010 the TV shows aired have increased from 25 to\n100. By the end of year 2017 the number of shows aired has reached more than 250, but its\ndrops to slightly above 175 the next year. The all time low of less than 12 seasons occurs in 1990.\n\nIn the years 1990,1996,2005,2007,2010,2011 and 2015 there are TV shows which has season above 30, but\nit should be reminded that according to the legend after season 20 there is no continuity.\n\nIf we focus closely until 2005 most of the TV shows have seasons up-to 10 , but after 2005 there\nare TV shows which aired season until 20.

The below section is to graphically represent the TV shows of a certain genre\nwith its seasons and when they were aired. \n\nTherefore I will not be factual, mostly biased towards the shows I watched and special \ncharacteristics. \n\n## Crime Drama Mystery\n\nLaw and Order of 20 seasons has been over for more than 5 years and it began airing in 1990.\nLaw and Order Special Victims Unit started airing in 1999 even now its still being aired.\nThere are also odd shows like which has not aired continuously and skipped an year or two.\nAmong them Columbo, Agatha Christie's Marple and II commissario Montalbano are  specially noted.\n\nThere are lot of shows which only aired one or two seasons only and then stopped. They also can\nbe noted from the bar plot. In the legend there are colors to indicate all the years from \n1990 to 2018.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsubset(Ratings,genres==\"Crime,Drama,Mystery\") %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x=fct_infreq(title),fill=factor(year(date)),color=factor(year(date))))+\n    geom_bar()+ coord_flip()+labs(color=\"Year\",fill=\"Year\")+\n    xlab(\"TV shows\")+ylab(\"Frequency\")+\n    ggtitle(\"'Crime,Drama,Mystery' Genre type over the Years\")+\n    scale_y_continuous(breaks=0:20,labels=0:20)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/Crime Drama Mystery-1.png){width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Comedy Drama\n\nSimilarly as above we can interpret the bar plot as well. But here the highest amount of\nseasons any TV show has reached is 9. Only the TV shows \"Scrubs\" and \"Shameless\" have reached \nthat milestone and both of them begin in different decades. \"Scrubs\" began in early 2000s, but\n\"Shameless\" was aired after 2010.\n\nIn the years 1998 and 1999 there were no TV shows aired under the genre \"Comedy,Drama\".\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsubset(Ratings,genres==\"Comedy,Drama\") %>%\n    ggplot(aes(x=fct_infreq(title),fill=factor(year(date)),color=factor(year(date))))+\n    geom_bar()+ coord_flip()+labs(color=\"Year\",fill=\"Year\")+\n    xlab(\"TV shows\")+ylab(\"Frequency\")+\n    ggtitle(\"'Comedy,Drama' Genre type over the Years\")+\n    scale_y_continuous(breaks=0:9,labels=0:9)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/Comedy and Drama-1.png){width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Drama\n\nMost of the TV shows in this genre type are limited to one season an a few more with 2 or 3 seasons.\nEven though most of them were aired after 2015. TV shows \"Mad Men\", \"Skins\" and \"The West Wing\"\nhas aired for 7 seasons. \n\nSome of these shows were limited series like \"The News Room\". The only very early TV show is \n\"Rebel Highway\" which was aired in 1994 and in year 2004 \"Summerland\" was aired, where\nboth of them were limited to one season. \n\nAccording to the legend the years 1992,1993,1995 to 1998 were years free of \"Drama\" genre\nTV shows.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsubset(Ratings,genres==\"Drama\") %>%\n ggplot(aes(x=fct_infreq(title),fill=factor(year(date)),color=factor(year(date))))+\n    geom_bar()+ coord_flip()+labs(color=\"Year\",fill=\"Year\")+\n    xlab(\"TV shows\")+ylab(\"Frequency\")+\n    ggtitle(\"'Drama' Genre type over the Years\")+\n    scale_y_continuous(breaks=0:7,labels=0:7)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/Drama-1.png){width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Rating over the years\n\nLets discuss regarding TV shows and their rating over the years with related to sharing.\nClearly we can see the number of shows increasing from 1990 to 2018. Oddly there was more\nsharing related to TV shows before 2000, but this is not the case after the birth of Millenium. To be honest\nsharing becomes more extinct even with the power of Internet and smart phones. \n\nIn perspective of rating the range is very much centered and small(between 7.5 - 9), but \nover the years this changes and expands to a wider range.(6.5 - 9.5). Only a handful \nof TV shows are rated below 5 in the scale over the year span of 28.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\np<-ggplot(Ratings,aes(x=factor(year(date)),y=av_rating,color=genres,size=share))+\n      geom_point(show.legend = FALSE)+ \n      labs(title = \"Ratings and Sharing : {frame_time}\"\n           ,x=\"Year\",y=\"Rating\")+\n      scale_y_continuous(breaks=2:10,labels=2:10)+\n      transition_time(date)+ease_aes('linear')+\n      theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))+\n      shadow_mark()\n\nanimate(p,fps= 5,duration =60)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/Rating vs Years-1.gif)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Tv Series with more than 14 Seasons\n\nThis is simply me trying to focus on the TV shows which has seasons more than 14 and\ntheir rating, sharing changes over the years.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\np<-subset(Ratings,title==\"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\"|\n          title==\"ER\"| title==\"Grey's Anatomy\"| title==\"Midsomer Murders\"| \n          title==\"Law & Order\"|\n          title==\"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\") %>%\nggplot(aes(x=seasonNumber,y=av_rating,color=title,size=share))+ \n      geom_point()+\n      labs(title = 'Season and Rating Year: {frame_time}',\n           x=\"Season\",y=\"Rating\")+\n      scale_x_continuous(breaks=1:20,labels=1:20)+\n      #scale_y_continuous(breaks=)\n      transition_time(date)+ease_aes('linear')+\n      shadow_mark()+theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\nanimate(p,fps=5,duration = 60)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/More than 14 Seasons-1.gif)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n*THANK YOU*\n",
