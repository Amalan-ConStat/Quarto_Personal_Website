Today for week 38, I am \ngoing to present my blog post in a presentation. This presentation does not include \nplots, but the code only. Therefore, I am putting the plots here. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n{{% tweet \"1074965237231697921\" %}}\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## IOS slide

1990 the creatures were captured.\n- From Birth Year 1971 to 2017 only the creatures are born.\n- After 1965 around 30 creatures have been rescued.\n- Close to 40 creatures with unknown status with Birth Year known.\n- Most of the rescued ones are of Male gender.\n\n\n## Species and their sex over current location (code)\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r

Species and their sex over current location (plot)\n\n- Plot 5\n- Close to 50 current locations.\n- There are few locations with only one type of species.\n- Bottle-nose creatures in most of these locations.\n- Sea Life park in Hawaii has a diverse amount of Species.\n- Sea world in San Diego is second when it comes to diversity.\n\n\n## Acquisitioned ones and thier Sex with Status (code)\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nPlot6<-ggplot(SeaCreature,aes(x=status,y=acquisition,color=sex))+\n       geom_jitter()+\n       ggtitle(\"Acquisitioned with Sex

6\n- Most of the Captured creatures are Dead, but few of them Released.\n- Most of the Rescued creatures are Dead, few alive and some Released.\n- In Unknown acquisition-ed type alot of them are Dead.\n- One rescued creature with unknown status.\n- 6 creatures which were born have been released and 50% are male.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n- Ios slides are NICE. \n- Jitter plots useful for categorical data.\n- Plots are too complex when using Location, Currently and Birth Year,\n  but manageable. \n- Bottle-nose species is holding a special place in this data-set.\n- Alot of unknown data points when it comes to Birth Year.\n\n\n*THANK YOU*\n",
