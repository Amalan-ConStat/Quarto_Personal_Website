# My-Personal-Website
I am using the quarto and theme by marvin schmitt to develop my own website with the help of R and Rstudio.

[Link to my Website](https://www.amalan-mahendran.com/) and [theme by marvin schmitt](https://www.marvinschmitt.com/blog/website-tutorial-quarto/)

Developing your own website is now more flexible if you are using quarto. 
Using RStudio  will make your life easier in this process. 
Additionally I am using the **renv** package to protect local environments.
Mostly this blog is about my Phd work, statistics, R programming, TidyTuesday.
