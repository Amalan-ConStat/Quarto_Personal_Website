Finally they decrease into their lowest \nof 64.64 death rate for Central Sub-Saharan Africa and 87.54 death rate for Western Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nSub-Saharan Africa Regions has a higher death rate performance through out the time line when it begins with 89.33 in 1990,\nand reaches its highest value of 96.28 in 2003. Further death rate decreases slowly up-to 51.93 in 2016, which is the least minimum\nvalue. Eastern Sub-Saharan Africa starts with 77.83 in 1990 and reaches its peak of 78.49 in 1991. In the next few years until 2000\nthere is small fluctuations. Finally there is a steep slope and reaches its lowest death rate value of 23.15 in 2016. \n\nDeath rate of Southern Sub-Saharan Africa is completely different than above four sub regions of Saharan Africa.

By 2016 all age categories reach a death count of zero, but in 1990 they are\nat different parts of the scale. \n\n* High SDI countries have a low death rate. While Low and Low middle SDI countries have the highest \ndeath rates over the years from 1990 to 2016. \n\n* In the Saharan region lowest death rate is for Southern Sub-Saharan region and highest death rate is \nfor Western Sub-Saharan region on the year 2016. This order is same for year 1990 as well in these \nregions. Highest death rate of all years and all sub regions occurs in year 2003 of 138.23 for  Western\nSub-Saharan Africa. While lowest death rate of all years and all sub regions is in year 1994 for Southern\nSub-Saharan Africa with 1.55.\n\n* European and Great Britain related regions have no malaria related incidents over the years of 1990 to\n2016, this could be because of their cold climate pattern and their developed status in the world.\n\n* North America shows figures of no malaria related deaths over the years of 1990 to 2016. Southern\nLatin America has the lowest death rate of 0.0035 in 2016 and highest death rate is for Central Latin\nAmerica. But in year 1990 highest death rate is for Andean Latin American region which is 0.354 and \nleast death rate is for Southern Latin America with 0.0208.\n\n* Australasia has no death rate over the years of 1990 to 2016. Where in year 2016 lowest death rate\noccurs to High Income Asia Pacific of 0.0008 and highest in that year for Oceania region with a value \nof 8.71. In the year 1990 highest death rate is for Oceania region with 14.78 but lowest is for \nHigh Income Asia Pacific region with 0.0073. A special occurrence where comparing all the regions and\nyears the highest death rate is for Oceania Region in year 2000.\n\n* Highest death rate occurs in year 2005 for North Africa and Middle East region, but in 1990 the \nmalaria death rate is 0.7968. Further in 2011 it hits the lowest value of 0.731 and finally\nmoves up-to 0.8332 in year 2016.\n\n* In year 1990 Caribbean region has a lower death rate than Latin American and Caribbean region.\nBut this gap gradually decreases over time and by year 2016 Caribbean region reaches a death rate of\n0.058 while Latin America and Caribbean region occupies the rate of 0.0468. \n\n# Further Analysis \n\n* This article only focuses on the death rate but we can expand it to countries and compare them\nover continents. \n\n* It is possible to consider the age category and compare the death counts of different regions \nto understand further of these regions. \n\n_Please see that_  \nThis is my third post on the internet so please be kind to tolerate my mistakes in grammar and spellings. \nI intend to post more statistics related materials in the future and learn accordingly.
