Fees and Percentage Points (15 Years) of the loan amount.\n\n## Fixed Rate 30 Years from 1971 to 2018\n\nEach week the Fixed Rate of 30 Years has been set and I am exploring how it changes \nin each year from 1971 to 2018. We can clearly see in the early Weeks of 1980 it has\nsignificantly increased higher than 17.5%, but in early 1970 it was only 7.5%. \n\nBy 1990 it has dropped to 7.5% and this pattern continues further until year 2018\nwhere in December the Fixed Rate of 30 Years is slightly less than 5%. \n\nEach year there can be one of the below patterns I mentioned if the year is divided into\ntwo half's. \n\n1. First and Second Half of the Year hold the same Percentage points.\n2. First Half of the Year has Higher percentage Points than the second half.\n3. Vice versa of 2.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\np<-ggplot(mortgage,aes(x=factor(year(date)),y=fixed_rate_30_yr,color=week(date)))+\n          geom_jitter()+transition_time(year(date))+ease_aes(\"linear\")+\n          shadow_mark()+xlab(\"Year\")+ylab(\"Fixed Rate 30 Year Mortgage (%)\")+\n          ggtitle(\"Fixed Rate 30 Year Morgage Change by the Year: {round(frame_time)}\")+\n          labs(color=\"Week of the Year\")+\n          theme(legend.position = \"bottom\",\n                axis.text.x =element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))\n    \nanimate(p,nframes=48, fps=1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/mortgage fixed rate 30 years-1.gif)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Fixed Rate 15 Years from 1991 to 2018\n\nFrom 1991 only we have Fixed Rate for 15 Years and in the beginning we can \nsee the percentage slightly above 8. and over the years it is decreasing while\nsome fluctuations occur.
