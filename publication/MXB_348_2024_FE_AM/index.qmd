## Abstract

This workshop introduces key tools for data manipulation and visualisation in _R_, focusing on the use of `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `ggplot2`, and `summarytools`. Participants learn how to transform and summarise data efficiently, apply the pipe operator to streamline workflows, and reshape datasets using `pivot_longer` and `pivot_wider`. Practical examples with the `storms` dataset demonstrate grouping, filtering, and plotting techniques, while additional case studies highlight applications such as attribution modelling with the `ChannelAttribution` package. The workshop emphasises reproducible workflows, clear data pipelines, and effective presentation of results using Quarto revealjs slides.
