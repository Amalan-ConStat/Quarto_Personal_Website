::: {#about-block}

I am a PhD student at the School of Mathematical Sciences, Queensland University of Technology working on "New methods of experimental design for subsampling under big data" and expecting to graduate in 2024. 

I completed my Bachelor of Science (Statistics Special) on the subjects Statistics, Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka. 

I am interested in applying statistical methods efficiently and effectively through the R statistical programming language. 
Conducting complex computations, writing reports and publishing them through R is my special skill over 7 years of experience.
Yes, I am proficient in R related tools base, tidyverse, Rshiny, golem, bookdown, rmarkdown and quarto.  

I have developed the below listed R packages and Shiny apps:
