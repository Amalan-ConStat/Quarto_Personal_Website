Trying to explain the data using maps is obvious, yet I\nwill use animated jitter plots. There are 13 variables and 2079 observations. Brave choice of \nlimiting my self to less than 10 variables, where latitude, longitude and Vehicles will not be\ntaken into account.\n\nSo with the help of packages tidyverse, ggthemr, gganimate,formattable and readr I will complete this\nanalysis. Most of the bridges are owned by several agencies, but I will only focus on the \ntop three ownership holders.\n\n## Counties which have bridges owned by State Highway Agency \n\nClose to 1000 bridges are owned by State Highway Agency, where most of them are in Baltimore\nCounty. High amount of bridges are in good condition, further more bridges are in Fair condition and\nonly around 10 bridges in Poor condition. \n\nConsidering the Average Daily Traffic only one bridge in Poor condition has the amount of \nclose to 110,000, while all the other poor condition bridges have Average Daily Traffic less\nthan 30,000. Counties Anne Arundel and Hartford have no Poor condition bridges at all.\n\nMost of the bridges are from Baltimore County and around 20 bridges have count of more than 150,000\nAverage Daily Traffic for both Fair and Good conditions. Hartford and Carroll Counties have \ntheir Average Daily Traffic which does not exceed 80,000 at any condition of the bridge.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# jitter plot to State Highway Agency\nggplot(subset(bridges,Owner==\"State Highway Agency\")\n       ,aes(color=Condition,y=`Average Daily Traffic`,x=str_wrap(County,7)))+\n  xlab(\"County\")+\n  ggtitle(\"Condition of Bridges owned by State Highway Agency \\nand their Average Daily Traffic\")+\n  scale_y_continuous(labels =seq(0,230000,10000) ,breaks = seq(0,230000,10000))+\n  transition_states(Condition,transition_length = 2,state_length = 3)+\n  enter_fade()+exit_shrink()+ease_aes(\"back-in\")+geom_jitter()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/County with Condition and Average Daily Traffic SHA-1.gif)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Counties which have bridges owned by  County Highway Agency \n\nCounty Highway Agency owns the second  most amount of bridges in this data-set. \nTherefore using jitter plots we are going to check how the condition of the bridges \nand counties are explained in the simplest manner. \n\nLess amount of poor condition bridges in all counties except Anne Roundel\nCounty. All bridges owned by County Highway Agency have a limited Average \nDaily Traffic less than 50,000. Clearly we have more Fair bridges than Good \nones. In the Poor condition category only two have Average Daily Traffic\nmore than 20,000, while other two have more than 10 bridges.\n\nMost of these bridges are in Baltimore County even it is in any one of three\nconditions. There are few bridges which have values more than 40,000 Average Daily\nTraffic and they are also in Baltimore County.\n\nThere are bridges which have Zero Average Daily Traffic. In all three Conditions\nonly Hartford County has bridges which has Average Daily Traffic less than \n10,000.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# jitter plot to County Highway Agency\nggplot(subset(bridges,Owner==\"County Highway Agency\")\n       ,aes(color=Condition,y=`Average Daily Traffic`,x=str_wrap(County,7)))+\n  xlab(\"County\")+ geom_jitter()+\n  ggtitle(\"Condition of Bridges owned by County Highway Agency \\nand their Average Daily Traffic\")+\n  scale_y_continuous(labels =seq(0,40000,5000) ,breaks = seq(0,40000,5000))+\n  transition_states(Condition,transition_length = 2,state_length = 3)+\n  enter_fade()+exit_shrink()+ease_aes(\"back-in\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/County with Condition and Average Daily Traffic CHA-1.gif)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n##  Counties which have bridges owned by  State Toll Authority\n\nThere is only one bridge which is in Poor condition and it is in Baltimore County, while counties\nHoward and Anne Arundel have no Good condition bridges. Further there is only 3 Fair condition\nbridges in Howard County while they have values for Average Daily Traffic less than 10,000. \n\nThe highest Average Daily Traffic is close to 170,000 which are only 4 and are in Good and Fair conditions.\nFurther, Anne Arundel County has only one Good bridge and in Hartford it is six bridges. Only few \nof the bridges have Average Daily Traffic close to zero. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# jitter plot to State tolll authority\nggplot(subset(bridges,Owner==\"State Toll Authority\")\n       ,aes(color=Condition,y=`Average Daily Traffic`,x=str_wrap(County,7)))+\n  xlab(\"County\")+geom_jitter()+\n  ggtitle(\"Condition of Bridges owned by State Toll Authority \\nand their Average Daily Traffic\")+\n  scale_y_continuous(labels =seq(0,170000,10000) ,breaks = seq(0,170000,10000))+\n  transition_states(Condition,transition_length = 2,state_length = 3)+\n  enter_fade()+exit_shrink()+ease_aes(\"back-in\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/County with Condition and Average Daily Traffic STA-1.gif)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Most amount of bridges Built based on Year \n\nYears 1957, 1970, 1975, 1991, 1963 and 1961 have the top 6 spots for building more than 50 bridges\nin those years. If we consider the conditions of Fair and Good only the year 1991 is suitable to be mentioned,\nwhile all other years has at-least one Poor condition bridge. Further There are more Poor condition bridges \nin 1961 than in 1957. While all Poor condition bridges has Average Daily Traffic less than 50,000. \n\nFinally, there are only few bridges which have Average Daily Traffic above 100,000 and only 3 are in Good\ncondition. There are Bridges which can have Average Daily Traffic close to zero in all 6 years and all conditions. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# jitter plot to years based on Most amount of bridges built\nggplot(subset(bridges,`Year Built`==\"1957\" | `Year Built`==\"1970\" | \n                `Year Built`==\"1975\" | `Year Built`==\"1991\" |\n                `Year Built`==\"1963\" | `Year Built`==\"1961\")\n       ,aes(color=Condition,y=`Average Daily Traffic`,x=factor(`Year Built`)))+\n  xlab(\"Year Built\")+ylab(\"Average Daily Traffic\")+\n  ggtitle(\"Most amount of Bridges built based on Years \\nand their Conditions\")+\n  geom_jitter()+legend_bottom()+\n  transition_states(Condition,transition_length = 2,state_length = 3)+\n  enter_fade()+exit_shrink()+ease_aes(\"back-in\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/Year Built with Condition and Average Daily Traffic-1.gif)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Average Traffic Less than or equal to 100,000 for Counties with Bridge Condition\n\nWhile obtaining summary for county variable there is one issue because there are two observations\nwhich say \"Baltimore city\" than \"Baltimore City\" and I don't want to change them. \n\nIf we focus on Average Daily Traffic less than or equal to 100,000 based on County and Condition. \nIt is clear that Poor condition bridges are part of this criteria and mostly Average Daily Traffic \nis less than 5000 for Counties Howard, Hartford and Carroll. While Baltimore County has highest amount \nup-to 75,000, but Baltimore County has highest amount close to 40,000 for Average Daily Traffic. \nFinally Anne Arundel County has only one Poor condition bridge which has Average Daily Traffic close to zero. \n\nWe can see that there are more Fair Condition bridges than Good ones. In Baltimore County most of the Fair\ncondition bridges have Average Daily Traffic less than 15000. Similarly Carroll county and Hartford county \nalso behave under such criteria. But for Good condition bridges this is not the case where there is no certain strong\ndense region as similar to Fair condition bridges. \n\nPreviously when we looked into county we did not see Baltimore City often as a factor, but here that is not the\ncase. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# jitter plot to average daily Traffic less than or equal 1000000\nggplot(subset(bridges,`Average Daily Traffic`<=100000 & County!=\"Baltimore city\"),\n       aes(x=County,y=`Average Daily Traffic`,color=Condition))+\n  xlab(\"County\")+ylab(\"Averag Daily Traffic\")+\n  ggtitle(\"Average Daily Traffic Less than 100,000 \\nFor Counties\")+\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = seq(0,100000,5000),breaks = seq(0,100000,5000))+\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = -90))+coord_flip()+ geom_jitter()+\n  transition_states(Condition,transition_length = 2,state_length = 3)+\n  enter_fade()+exit_shrink()+ease_aes(\"back-in\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/Average Traffic less than 100000-1.gif)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Average Traffic More than  100,000 for Counties with Bridge Condition\n\nThis Jitter plot is completely different than previous one, because there are no clear dense regions \nfor any counties and conditions of the bridge. There is only one Poor condition bridge in Baltimore County\nwhere the Average Daily Traffic is close to 115,000. In Fair condition bridges also Baltimore County holds \nthe most, while they are slightly dense in the region of 175,000 to 190,000. while for Howard County similar\ndensity occurs between 190,000 to 205,000. Bridges in Good condition have more higher values in Baltimore County\nthan Anne Arundel County. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# jitter plot to average daily Traffic more than  1000000\nggplot(subset(bridges, `Average Daily Traffic` > 100000 & County != \"Baltimore city\"),\n       aes(x=County,y=`Average Daily Traffic`,color=Condition))+\n  xlab(\"County\")+ylab(\"Average Daily Traffic\")+\n  ggtitle(\"Average Daily Traffic More than 100,000 \\nFor Counties\")+\n  scale_y_continuous(labels=seq(100000,230000,5000),breaks=seq(100000,230000,5000))+\n  coord_flip()+ theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = -90))+\n  geom_jitter()+transition_states(Condition,transition_length = 2,state_length = 3)+\n  enter_fade()+exit_shrink()+ease_aes(\"back-in\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/Average Traffic more than 100000-1.gif)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Improvement and Bridge Conditions with Counties \n\nIn the variable of Total Improvement there are 1438 missing values, 42 values are zero and \nthe rest are actual values. I am going to look at Total Improvement in two tables. First \ntable will include where Bridges have Total Improvement higher than 9,999,000 USD and less than \n30,000,000 USD. Second table is for Bridges which have Total Improvement higher than or equal to \n30,000,000 USD. \n\nFurther to make these tables interesting I will be using the package formattable, and \ncolors and tiles for numerical values. In the first table there are 7 bridges while \nonly Anne Arundel County holds 3 and Baltimore City holds 4. One bridge is from 1953, and others\nare from the period of 1977 to 1983. Conditions of these bridges are mostly Fair and two bridges \nare in Good condition. Lowest Average Daily Traffic is 11760, while highest is 124193, where both bridges \nare in Fair Condition, and the amount spent on them for Total Improvement are respectively 18,163,000 USD\nand 16,264,000 USD. The bridge with Highest amount of Average Daily traffic is built in 1953.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# removing unnecessary columns and setting restriction to \n# Total Improvement\nTop10<-subset(bridges[,c(-1,-2,-9,-10,-11,-12,-13)], \n              `Total Improvement` > 9999 & `Total Improvement` < 30000)\n\n# setting colours\ncustomRed0 = \"#FF8080\"\ncustomRed = \"#7F0000\"\n\ncustomyellow0 = \"#FFFF80\"\ncustomyellow = \"#BFBF00\"\n\ncustomblue0 = \"#6060BF\"\ncustomblue =  \"#00007F\"\n\n# creating the table for above data set\nformattable(Top10,align=c(\"l\",\"l\",\"c\",\"c\",\"c\",\"c\"),\n            list(\n              County =formatter(\"span\",style= ~style(color=\"grey\")),\n            `Total Improvement`=color_tile(customblue0,customblue),\n            `Average Daily Traffic`=color_tile(customyellow0,customyellow),\n            `Year Built`=color_tile(customRed0,customRed)\n            ))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n<table class=\"table table-condensed\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> County </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Carries </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> Year Built </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> Condition </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> Average Daily Traffic </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> Total Improvement </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> <span style=\"color: grey\">Anne Arundel County</span> </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> MD 2 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> <span style=\"display: block;
