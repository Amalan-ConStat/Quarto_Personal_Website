Out of the Top 10 places (considering the most\nlaunches) it is clear that class D agencies has the most amount (of 5),while 3 from class C agencies and the rest with \nclass B. NASA is in third place with 469 launches and it is a class C agency. My favorite agency Space X (SPX) has launched 65\ntimes and it is a class B agency.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(agencies,aes(x=fct_inorder(agency),y=count,\n                    color=class,fill=class))+\n       geom_bar(stat=\"identity\",width=0.75)+coord_flip()+\n       geom_text(label=agencies$count, hjust=-0.15)+\n       xlab(\"Space Agency\")+ylab(\"Frequency\")+\n       ggtitle(\"Space Agency vs Frequency By Class\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/Agency vs Count and class-1.png){width=1056}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSimilarly, for the same bar plot if we change color according to agency type we have different insight.\nTop 10 agencies is 90% filled with state ownership and 10% is with private ownership.

There is more activity after this regularly but they are short lived\nfor these agencies.
